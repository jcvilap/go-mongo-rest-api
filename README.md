# Single-route REST API written purely in Go
Sample single-route REST API written purely in Go. No dependencies added. After starting several REST APIs from scratch, 
I decided to create this place holder for reuse.

Note: All the files besides ` main.go ` were placed within the vendor folder to avoid using relative paths.
