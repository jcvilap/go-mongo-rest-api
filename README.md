# Single-route REST API written purely in Go
This is a simple, single-route, REST API written purely in Go. No external dependencies added. After starting several 
REST APIs apps from scratch, I decided to create this place holder for reuse.

Note: All the files besides ` main.go ` were placed within the vendor folder to avoid using relative paths.
